# A Novel Approach for Assessing Fairness in Deployed Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for evaluating the fairness of machine learning (ML) algorithms. The approach uses k-fold cross-validation and statistical t-tests to assess ML fairness across various datasets and algorithms.
